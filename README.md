This time series data analysis project was made as an reinterpretation of code provided in R to Python. 
The analysis was part of the lecture on Financial Econometrics.

The goal of this analysis is to find model that best fits the time series data. 
The data used in this project is the daily quotation of stock prices of four indices - S&P 500, DAX 30, FTSE 100 and NIKKEI 225 from January 7, 1994 to January 29, 2018.
